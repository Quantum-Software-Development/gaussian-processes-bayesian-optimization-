## Introduction  

### What are Gaussian Processes?  

Gaussian Processes are a powerful and flexible statistical tool used for regression and classification tasks. They provide a probabilistic framework for modeling complex functions by defining a distribution over functions rather than fitting a single function. This allows us to quantify uncertainty in our predictions. GPs are particularly useful when dealing with small datasets where traditional methods may struggle.  

### What is Bayesian Optimization?  

Bayesian Optimization is a strategy for finding the minimum or maximum of an expensive function that is often noisy or has unknown gradients. It utilizes Gaussian Processes as a surrogate model to guide the search for the optimal solution. By iteratively refining this model and focusing on areas of the input space that are likely to yield better results, Bayesian Optimization is particularly effective for optimizing hyperparameters in machine learning models, tuning engineering designs, and other real-world applications where evaluating the objective function is costly.
